# VoS-Assistant
iOS and watchOS app assistant for Runescape's Voice of Seren

VoS Assistant is a program that parses the current clans from Jagex's automated Twitter account, @JagexClock. It is written in SwiftUI and provides a native iOS and iPadOS app, a watchOS app with a static watchface complication, as well as a Today extension.

The app can be downloaded from Apple's [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-of-seren-assistant/id1492421745).


The app will likely not recieve any first-party updates anytime soon, but the foundation for system notifications and dynamic watch complications are in the code already. If any pull requests are submitted implementing either of these features, I'll update the build on the App Store and credit the contributor in the description.
